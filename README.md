Data Architecture for a Heart Failure Decision Support Tool
## Overview
Our project will create a decision support tool to assist clinicians who care for patients with heart failure. 
This tool utilises current clinical guidelines to support decision-making for clinicians to maximise the delivery of evidence-based treatment. 
The first step is to create a user interface to capture patient-related data to link to the clinical guideline. 
The next step in our project will be to integrate the decision support tool with the information from existing hospital administrative and clinical databases.

The objective in this project is to convert the outputs of software related to heart failure into FHIR standard inputs to be utilised by developed software.
